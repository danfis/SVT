# SVT

SVT - Simple Visualization Tool - is program for graphical visualization of objects in 3D space.

This tool was created to support me in making programs and libraries which deal with 3d (or 2d) objects. I needed any program which is able to show me a results of some algorithm and automated tests. A many times I needed to see more than one object at once and I needed to turn on and off some and to change some properties of others. I haven't found anything satisfactory - so SVT was created.

SVT uses its own format of input data. It is so because existing formats, such as VRML, are too complex or does not provide features SVT needs. SVT data format is very simple.

SVT is based on libraries [Coin3d](http://www.coin3d.org/),
[Quarter](http://www.coin3d.org/) and [Qt 4](http://qt.nokia.com/products) - all available under GPL license.
